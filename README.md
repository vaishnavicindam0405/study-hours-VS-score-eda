This project explores the relationship between hours studied and exam scores using a small dataset. It includes basic exploratory data analysis (EDA) steps such as:

-Viewing dataset structure (head, info, describe)

-Checking missing values

-Analyzing distributions

-Visualizing the relationship between study hours and score using Matplotlib

-Calculating correlation between study hours and exam score
